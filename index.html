	<h1>Thousands of Public School Students in Washington State Head Back to Class in Schools with 'Very High' Seismic Risks</h1>
  <p>As students in Washington State head back to school to start the upcoming school year, many students will be attending schools that are known to be unsafe in an earthquake. Older schools, particularly those built before the 1970s, face the highest risk of collapse in an earthquake. The state is vulnerable to multiple fault lines, including the <a href="https://pnsn.org/outreach/earthquakesources/csz">Cascadia Subduction Zone</a> located in the Pacific Ocean, which can produce megathrust earthquakes of 9.0 magnitude or higher, and the  <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/earthquake">Seattle Fault</a>, which can produce earthquakes of up to 7.5 magnitude in the center of the city. Both fault lines are known to produce earthquakes hundreds of years apart.
  <p>While <a href="https://efkodon.github.io/schools_data_access/">multiple efforts</a> are underway to better track, upgrade and replace high risk school buildings statewide, the process will take years and is <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dnr/geologydata/school_seismic_safety/phase2/School_Seismic_Safety_Project_2021_Final_Report_DNR.pdf">expected</a> to cost billions of dollars to complete. Schools that are located in tsunami risk zones face a double threat from an earthquake and possible resulting tsunami. For Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquakes, the tsunami threat is concentrated along the Pacific coast, while Seattle Fault Zone earthquakes have the potential to produce a tsunami from the Puget Sound, threatening the city of Seattle and surrounding areas.</p>
  <p>The maps below show the predicted seismic impact zones for the Cascadia Subduction Zone and the Seattle Fault Zone, highlighting King County, the most populous county in the state, with more than 2.2 million residents. Chart numbers represent the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI), or peak ground acceleration values and impact of shaking, which varies from the predicted earthquake magnitude used to create the models.<p>

  <br>
  <p>In King County, <a href="https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us">nearly 35,000 students</a> attended 60 public schools for preschool to 12th grade with one or more "very high" risk buildings last year. The seismic risk ratings, which range from "low" to "very high", were provided by the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/">Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI)</a> in response to a public records request in July 2023. As data collection is ongoing, ratings were provided for about 880 out of 1,992 listed schools. The data shows about 200 schools rated "very high" risk, and about 70 schools rated "high" risk, although some have already been renovated or rebuilt. The OSPI assessments take many factors into account when determining the overall risk rating for each school site. Each of the seismic impact zones shown in the maps above contain school buildings with a range of ratings that may depend on building age, construction type, soil density, and other metrics.</p>
  <p>The map below shows the 60 schools in King County that are designated in the OSPI data as having "very high" seismic risk, with no seismic renovation recorded. Multiple additional schools marked as "very high" risk that were found to have renovation or reconstruction work currently underway, or that have already been reconstructed or closed, were omitted from the list below. In addition, Seattle Public Schools maintains a <a href="https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/capital-projects-and-planning/facilities-master-plan/seismic-information/">list of seismic upgrades</a> that have been made to district schools, including some of those listed below. It is outside the scope of this project to confirm whether any additional schools rated as "very high" risk by OSPI and appearing in the may below may have renovation or reconstruction work underway or completed that is not reflected in the data.</p>

  <h3>Taking a Closer Look at School Construction</h3>
  <p>According to the state's School Seismic Safety Project <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/dnr/geologydata/school_seismic_safety/phase2/School_Seismic_Safety_Project_2021_Final_Report_DNR.pdf">final report</a> published in June 2021, buildings that are most at risk of collapse in an earthquake are: 1. Buildings made with unreinforced masonry (URM) before the 1940s, and non-ductile concrete buildings (without seismic upgrades) constructed before the mid-1970s; 2. Buildings constructed prior to 1975 out of reinforced masonry and wood frame materials. Data collected in 2018 for the <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/com/urmasonary/urmasonary/#7/47.347/-121.029/">Washington URM Dashboard</a> identified 219 confirmed or suspected URM schools, including 34 confirmed URM public schools. The Seattle City Council passed a <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings#:~:text=What%27s%20Happening%20Now%3F,unreinforced%20masonry%20buildings%20(URMs)">resolution</a> in December 2021 to establish a framework for a mandatory retrofit ordinance for the estimated 1,100 URMs in the city, but this ordinance does not apply to the surrounding cities shown in the map above.</p>
  <p> The OSPI data shows 168 school sites statewide with at least one of three URM construction types: <i>URM bearing walls</i>, and concrete or steel frames with <i>URM infill walls</i>. It is unclear which of these three construction types presents the highest risks. URM buildings are sometimes identifiable via an alternating <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/unreinforced-masonry-buildings-(urm)-">brick pattern</a> with a narrow brick width every 5-6 rows (though some URM buildings are constructed with clay tiles), and by low or flat arched windows, historical records, and on-site assessments.</p>
  <p>Several "very high" risk schools from the map above are shown in more detail below.</p>

In the OSPI data, the school is listed as having "concrete shear walls", with "very high" seismic risk in the two main building areas that were assessed, and "low" risk in the performing arts center following renovations in 2008.

<h3>The Shoreline School District</h3>
<p>Sitting just north of Seattle, the Shoreline School District has 16 public schools. The map below shows the portion of schools with each risk rating, as well as the schools with no current assessment. This includes four newer and safer schools that were recently constructed. However, substantial risks remain at seven district schools.</p>
