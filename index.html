	<h1>As Students in Washington State Head Back to Class, Information about the Seismic Readiness of School Buildings is Hard to Find</h1>
  <p><strong>By Emily Keller-O'Donnell</strong></p>
  <p>August 13, 2023</p>
  <p>As the start of the upcoming school year approaches, many students in Washington State will be attending schools that may be unsafe in a major earthquake. However, following years of modernization efforts and millions of dollars spent on renovations and reconstruction to enable school buildings to better withstand a major tremor, information about the seismic readiness of school buildings remains difficult to obtain. While information is available on a case-by-case basis depending on the district, there is no publicly available state database to search for individual schools, and the available resources are sometimes out of date.</p>
  <p>School districts often announce capital projects to upgrade or replace school buildings on their websites, but information about older school buildings that are not in line for upgrades are not included. The <a href="https://www.dnr.wa.gov/school-seismic-safety">School Seismic Safety Project</a> provided risk assessment reports for a portion of Washington school districts following a $3.4 million project to conduct geological and engineering assessments of 339 schools from 2017-2021, but not all districts are included.</p>
  <p>The Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) maintains a <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/policy-funding/school-buildings-facilities/information-and-condition-schools-icos">database</a> that includes seismic risk ratings of "low", "moderate", "high" and "very high" for individual school buildings, but the data is complicated to interpret and not publicly available (the data was obtained for this article via a public records request). The assessments take many factors into account, such as proximity to faults, building age, construction type, soil density, and retrofit construction. As data collection is ongoing, risk assessments are provided for 880 listed schools - less than half of the 1,992 schools listed in the data.  But some information has not been updated to reflect school closures or reconstruction. It is also unclear why the data contains fewer schools than OSPI's list of 2,552 public schools in the <a href="https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/23bbd746f9924c149681815cfd2a6300_0/about">Washington Geospatial Open Data Portal</a>. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Earthquake Risks in Washington State</h2>
  <p>The Washington State Department of Natural Resources lists <a href="https://www.dnr.wa.gov/seismic-scenarios#list-of-scenarios-for-download">20 potential seismic events</a> that could strike the state. The last major earthquake to hit the region was the 6.8 magnitude Nisqually quake in 2001, which occurred at night, when school children were not in class.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://pnsn.org/outreach/earthquakesources/csz">Cascadia Subduction Zone</a>, located offshore in the Pacific Ocean, is estimated to produce megathrust earthquakes of 9.0 magnitude or higher about once every 400-600 years. The last known megathrust earthquake along this fault occurred in the year 1700. Some scientists have estimated that there is a <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oem/hazardsprep/pages/cascadia-subduction-zone.aspx">37 percent chance</a> of a megathrust earthquake of 7.1 magnitude or higher along this fault line in the next 50 years.</p>

    <center><img src="images/cascadia_wa.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="Impact zones for Seattle zone earthquake overlapping with school locations on a map of Washington State, with an outline around King County"</center>
  </div>
  <p> The <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/earthquake">Seattle Fault</a> can produce earthquakes of up to 7.5 magnitude in the center of the city anywhere from 200-15,000 years apart. The last known quake along this fault line, which runs horizontally across the city, was 1,100 years ago. In the earthquake scenario pictured below, Seattle and surrounding areas in western King County are predicted to experience ground shaking of 7.0-9.0 Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI), a localized measurement that is distinct from earthquake magnitudes along a fault line. Many schools would face a double threat from an earthquake and possible resulting <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/earthquake-tsunami-seattle-fault-study/">tsunami</a> from Puget Sound.</p>
  <p>About one in five Washington State public schools are located in King County, which has <a href="https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/23bbd746f9924c149681815cfd2a6300/explore?location=47.208254%2C-120.802250%2C7.00">523 schools</a>. This area includes the Seattle School District, the <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/about-ospi/about-school-districts">largest school district</a> in the state, with an estimated 55,000 students.<p>

</div>
<h2>Taking a Closer Look at School Construction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/com/urmasonary/urmasonary/#7/47.347/-121.029/">Washington URM Dashboard</a>, created in 2018, provides an inventory of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings, often built before the 1940s, which are considered one of the most dangerous types of buildings in an earthquake. At a cost of $200,000, the study identified 1,176 confirmed URM buildings across the state, including 34 public schools and 42 private schools. Many school names are omitted from the dashboard, leaving users to search listed addresses online to find school names. In December 2021, the Seattle City Council passed a <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/changes-to-code/unreinforced-masonry-buildings#:~:text=What%27s%20Happening%20Now%3F,unreinforced%20masonry%20buildings%20(URMs)">resolution</a> to establish a framework for a mandatory retrofit ordinance for all of the URMs in the city.</p>
<p>One in twelve schools in the OSPI data had at least one  URM construction type listed: <i>URM bearing walls</i>, or concrete or steel frames with <i>URM infill walls</i>. URM buildings are often identifiable via an alternating <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/emergency-management/hazards/unreinforced-masonry-buildings-(urm)-">brick pattern</a> with a narrow brick width every 5-6 rows. But URMs do not tell the whole story. A comparison of two schools below illustrates the complexity of understanding risk levels at individual schools according to construction type alone.</p>

<h2>Identifying Public Schools with "Very High" Seismic Risks in King County</h2>
<p>An analysis of the OSPI data shows 60 public schools in King County with a "very high" earthquake risk rating, after excluding the schools that will not be hosting students at their listed location this fall due to ongoing or completed renovations or reconstruction found on school websites. The 60 schools shown below, which serve grades from preschool to 12th grade, had more than 34,000 <a href="https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us">enrolled students</a> last year. The identification of these schools as having "very high" earthquake risks is based on OSPI data, and has not been independently verified.</p>
